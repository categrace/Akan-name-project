# Akan Name Generator
This project contains a generator that derives an Akan name corresponding to the day of the week that a user was born, which they provide.

# Description
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week a child is born, and on the gender of the child. This  Akan name generator takes a user's birthdate and gender information, and derives an Akan name.
