            <h1>Akan name Generator</h1>
            <p>Hello! Welcome to the Akan name generator application</p>
            <p>Akans are a meta-ethnicity who live in Ghana and Ivory Coast who have a very unique way in which they name their children,
                after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. 
                Boys and girls have unique names meaning genders are also a consideration.
    
            </p>
            <hr class= "my-auto" />
            <p>The table below lists the Female and Male Akan names according to days of the week of birth, 
                consider using the name generator by keying in the<strong> correct gender,date,month and year</strong> of birth
                to know your Akan name.
